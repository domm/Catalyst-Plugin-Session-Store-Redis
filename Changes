    - add reconnect param (domm)


0.05    December 20th, 2009
    - Remove connection setup from setup_session method so that connections
      are created later.  This allow pre-fork setups to create connections 
      after the fork. (Thanks Richard Soderberg)

0.04    December 12th, 2009
    - Update POD wrt expiry

0.03    December 12th, 2009
    - Fix POD description
    - Fix logging typo (said 'Getting key' when it meant 'Setting key')
    - Use Redis' EXPIRE command to build in session expiration so we can
      ignore it. As such, delete_expired_sessions is now a null-op.
    - Unify connection code that was previously duplicated in setup_session
    - Test against Redis 1.02 and 1.1.91-beta
