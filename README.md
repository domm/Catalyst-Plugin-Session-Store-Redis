# DESCRIPTION

`Catalyst::Plugin::Session::Store::Redis` is a session storage plugin for
Catalyst that uses the Redis ([http://redis.io/](http://redis.io/)) key-value
database.

## CONFIGURATION

### redis\_server

The IP address and port where your Redis is running. Default: 127.0.0.1:6379

### redis\_debug

Boolean flag to turn Redis debug messages on/off. Default: 0, i.e. off

Turing this on will cause the Redis Perl bindings to output debug
messages to STDOUT. This setting does not influence the logging this
module does via `$c->log`

### redis\_reconnect

Boolean flag. Default: 0, i.e. off.

It is highly recommended that you enable this setting. If set to `0`,
your app might not be able to reconnect to `Redis` if the `Redis`
server was restarted.

I leave the default of setting at `0` for now because changing it
might break existing apps.

# NOTES

- **Expired Sessions**

    This store does **not** automatically expires sessions.  There is no need to
    call `delete_expired_sessions` to clear any expired sessions.

    domm: No idea what this means.

- **session expiry**

    Currently this module does not use `Redis` Expiry to clean out old
    session. I might look into this in the future. But patches are welcome!
